# Editor Jump

Provides a way to quickly switch to an arbitrary editor groups and some views
such as search or SCM.

Bind `editorJump.jump` to a keyboard shortcut to quickly jump between editor
groups. A decoration will be applied to all visible editors which tells you
what key to press to focus it. There are a set of hard-coded keys as well for
focusing different UI elements, as well as a key to jump to the previously
focused view.
